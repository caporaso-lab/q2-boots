q2-boots is a [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) plugin providing bootstrapped and rarefaction-based (i.e., resampled) alpha and beta diversity analyses, designed to mirror the interface of q2-diversity.

## Development status

q2-boots is in beta release. It is sufficiently validated and ready for real-world data analysis, but **interfaces are still subject to change**. For example, default parameter settings, command names, and outputs generated by specific commands may evolve as we get usability feedback and feature requests from users.

## Installation

### Install Prerequisites

[Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) provides the `conda` environment and package manager, and is currently the only supported way to install QIIME 2.
Follow the instructions for downloading and installing Miniconda.

After installing Miniconda and opening a new terminal, make sure you're running the latest version of `conda`, and install `wget` in case you don't already have it.

```bash
conda update conda
conda install wget
```

### QIIME 2024.10 development version of q2-boots

Installing the most recent development version of q2-boots allows you to access the most recent functionality, including some that depends on features being introduced in QIIME 2 2024.10.
It is hard to unambiguously reference development versions of software in publications however, so you'll likely want to re-run your boots analyses with a release version prior to publication.

```shell
conda env create -n q2-boots-2024.10 -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiime2/q2-boots/main/environments/q2-boots-qiime2-amplicon-2024.10.yml
```

```shell
conda activate q2-boots-2024.10
```

## Using `q2-boots`

After completing the install steps above, make QIIME 2's command line interface aware of `q2-boots` by running:

```shell
qiime dev refresh-cache
```

You should then see the plugin in the list of available plugins if you run:

```shell
qiime info
```

You should be able to review the help text by running:

```shell
qiime boots --help
```

Have fun! ðŸ˜Ž
