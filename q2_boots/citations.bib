               bootstrapped and rarefaction-based microbiome diversity analysis.
               This plugin provides eight new actions that allow users to apply
               any of thirty different alpha diversity metrics and twenty-two
               beta diversity metrics to bootstrapped or rarefied feature
               tables, using a single QIIME 2 Pipeline command, or more granular
               QIIME 2 Action commands. Results: Given a feature table, an even
               sampling depth, and the number of iterations to perform (n), the
               command qiime boots core-metrics will resample the feature table
               n times and compute alpha and beta diversity metrics on each
               resampled table. The results will be integrated in summary data
               artifacts that are identical in structure and type to results
               that would be generated by applying diversity metrics to a single
               table. This enables all the same downstream analytic tools to be
               applied to these tables and ensures that all collected data is
               considered when computing microbiome diversity metrics.
               Conclusions: A challenge of this work was deciding how to
               integrate distance matrices that were computed on n resampled
               feature tables, as a simple average of pairwise distances (median
               or mean) does not account for the structure of distance matrices.
               q2-boots provides three options, and we show here that the
               results of these approaches are highly correlated. q2-boots is
               free and open source. Source code can be found at
               https://github.com/caporaso-lab/q2-boots; installation
               instructions and a tutorial can be found in the projectâ€™s

  abstract = "K-mer frequency information in biological sequences is used for a
              wide range of applications, including taxonomy classification,
              sequence similarity estimation, and supervised learning. However,
              in spite of its widespread utility, k-mer counting has been
              largely neglected for diversity estimation. This work examines the
              application of k-mer counting for alpha and beta diversity as well
              as supervised classification from microbiome marker-gene
              sequencing datasets (16S rRNA gene and full-length fungal ITS
              sequences). Results demonstrate a close correspondence with
              phylogenetically aware diversity metrics, and advantages for using
              k-mer-based metrics for measuring microbial biodiversity in
              microbiome sequencing surveys. K-mer counting appears to be a
              suitable and efficient strategy for feature processing prior to
              diversity estimation as well as supervised learning in microbiome
              surveys. This allows incorporation of subsequence-level
              information into diversity estimation without the computational
              cost of pairwise sequence alignment. K-mer counting is proposed as
              a complementary approach for feature processing prior to diversity
              estimation and supervised learning analyses, enabling large-scale
              reference-free profiling of microbiomes in biogeography, ecology,
              and biomedical data. A method for k-mer counting from marker-gene
              sequence data is implemented in the QIIME 2 plugin q2-kmerizer
