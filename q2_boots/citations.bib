  abstract      = "Background: We present q2-boots, a QIIME 2 plugin that
                   facilitates bootstrapped and rarefaction-based microbiome
                   diversity analysis. This plugin provides eight new actions
                   that allow users to apply any of thirty different alpha
                   diversity metrics and twenty-two beta diversity metrics to
                   bootstrapped or rarefied feature tables, using a single QIIME
                   2 Pipeline command, or more granular QIIME 2 Action commands.
                   Results: Given a feature table, an even sampling depth, and
                   the number of iterations to perform (n), the command qiime
                   boots core-metrics will resample the feature table n times
                   and compute alpha and beta diversity metrics on each
                   resampled table. The results will be integrated in summary
                   data artifacts that are identical in structure and type to
                   results that would be generated by applying diversity metrics
                   to a single table. This enables all of the same downstream
                   analytic tools to be applied to these tables, and ensures
                   that all collected data is considered when computing
                   microbiome diversity metrics. Conclusions: A challenge of
                   this work was deciding how to integrate distance matrices
                   that were computed on n resampled feature tables, as a simple
                   average of pairwise distances (median or mean) does not
                   account for the structure of distance matrices. q2-boots
                   provides three options, and we show here that the results of
                   these approaches are highly correlated. q2-boots is free and
                   open source. Source code, installation instructions, and a
                   tutorial can be found at
