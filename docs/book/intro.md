:::{note} Development status
:class: dropdown

q2-boots is in beta release.
It is sufficiently validated and ready for real-world data analysis, but **interfaces are still subject to change**.
For example, default parameter settings, command names, and outputs generated by specific commands may evolve as we get usability feedback and feature requests from users.
